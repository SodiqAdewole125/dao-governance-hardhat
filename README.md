# DAO Governance
Here is the contract code of the DAO Platform. This project is aimed at illustrating some of the various concepts of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Decentralize Autonomous Organization is a group of people who come together without a central leader or company dictating any of the decisions.  
It is deployed on the Mumbai testnet.

# Features
1. The platform provides a custom governance token called LAR ðŸ˜Ž . This token is required to perform various activites on the DAO.
2. Any one can create a proposal and you must have at least 5 LAR token in your wallet before you can create one.
3. Three voting systems are provided in the platform;
    * Single Choice Voting System: When you create a proposal with the single choice voting system, voters can only vote for a single option. Your voting power is proportional to the amount of LAR token you have in your wallet. 
  
    * Quadratic Voting System: A proposal created with this voting system can allow users to spread their votes across multiple options and their vote equals the square root of their voting power. That is, if you spread 25 LAR Tokens on an option, the vote you casted will equal 5 votes
  
    * Weighted Voting system: This kind of voting system allows users to vote multiple options. So, they can show the level of support or opposition they have for the options they are voting for.


# Technologies
1. **Open Zeppelin**: The contract uses IERC20 of OpenZeppelin create an instance of LAR token.
2. **Hardhat**: The smart contract framework used for the project is hardhat. Hardhat provides a lot of functionalities that enables efficient and flexible deployments, unit and integration testing of the contract.
5. **Next JS**: Next JS is the front end framework used to ensure flexible user interaction.
6. **Tailwind CSS**
8. **ethers.js**
9. **Moralis**
